`proxy_hide_header` is an **NGINX directive** used to prevent specific response headers from being passed from the upstream server (backend) to the client.

It’s commonly used in reverse proxy setups.

---

## 🔹 What It Does

When NGINX proxies a request to a backend (via `proxy_pass`), the backend returns response headers.

By default, NGINX forwards most of those headers to the client.

`proxy_hide_header` tells NGINX:

> "Do NOT send this specific header to the client."

---

## 🔹 Syntax

```nginx
proxy_hide_header <header_name>;
```

---

## 🔹 Example

### Backend returns:

```
Server: Apache/2.4.54
X-Powered-By: PHP/8.2
```

### NGINX config:

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://backend;
    proxy_hide_header X-Powered-By;
    proxy_hide_header Server;
}
```

### Result to client:

Those headers will NOT be visible.

---

## 🔹 Common Use Cases

### 1️⃣ Security Hardening

Hide internal technology details:

```nginx
proxy_hide_header X-Powered-By;
proxy_hide_header Server;
```

### 2️⃣ Remove Cache Headers from Backend

```nginx
proxy_hide_header Cache-Control;
proxy_hide_header Expires;
```

Then define your own caching behavior.

### 3️⃣ Override Location Header (Redirect Control)

Sometimes used together with:

```nginx
proxy_redirect
```

---

## 🔹 Important Notes

### 1️⃣ Default Hidden Headers

NGINX already hides some headers by default:

- `Date`
- `Server`
- `X-Pad`
- `X-Accel-*`

If you want to allow them, use:

```nginx
proxy_pass_header Server;
```

---

### 2️⃣ Context

Can be used inside:

- `http`
- `server`
- `location`

---

### 3️⃣ Does NOT Modify Backend

It only affects what is sent to the client.
The backend response remains unchanged.

| Directive              | Purpose                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `proxy_set_header`     | Modify request headers sent to backend |
| `proxy_pass_header`    | Allow hidden headers                   |
| `proxy_ignore_headers` | Ignore certain headers from backend    |
| `add_header`           | Add response headers                   |

---

## 🔹 Quick Real-World Example (Common in AWS ALB → NGINX → App)

If your backend (like a Java or Node app on EC2/EKS) leaks:

```
X-Powered-By: Express
```

You can hide it at NGINX layer before traffic goes through CloudFront or ALB:

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://app;
    proxy_hide_header X-Powered-By;
}
```
