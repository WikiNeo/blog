In a PyPI (or PyPI-compatible) index URL, **`/simple` refers to the “Simple API”** defined by **PEP 503**.

### What the “simple” index is

The **Simple Repository API** is a **minimal, machine-friendly HTML interface** that Python packaging tools (like `pip`, `uv`, `poetry`) use to discover and download packages.

Example:

```
https://pypi.org/simple/
```

or in Artifactory:

```
https://<host>/artifactory/api/pypi/<repo>/simple/
```

### Why it’s called “simple”

It’s intentionally:

- **Static**
- **HTML only** (no JSON, no UI)
- **Easy to parse by tools**

Each page is just a list of links.

Example package page:

```
https://pypi.org/simple/requests/
```

HTML (simplified):

```html
<a href="requests-2.31.0-py3-none-any.whl">requests-2.31.0</a>
<a href="requests-2.30.0.tar.gz">requests-2.30.0</a>
```

### What `/simple` is used for

`pip` and similar tools **require** the Simple API for package resolution:

```bash
pip install requests \
  --index-url https://pypi.org/simple
```

or in `requirements.txt`:

```txt
--index-url https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/pypi/my-repo/simple
```

### What `/simple` is NOT

- ❌ Not a web UI
- ❌ Not browseable like `/ui/native/...`
- ❌ Not a REST JSON API

That’s why:

- You **can** open `/ui/native/...` in a browser
- You **cannot** meaningfully “browse” `/simple` except as raw HTML

### Why your Artifactory URLs behave differently

In Artifactory:

| URL                                        | Purpose                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `/ui/native/SPNKR-pypi/...`                | Human UI                      |
| `/artifactory/api/pypi/SPNKR-pypi/simple/` | **pip-compatible Simple API** |

If `pip` can’t access the `/simple` endpoint, it’s usually due to:

- Missing authentication
- Wrong repository type
- Proxy vs local repo mismatch
- Incorrect credentials in Docker build

### Key takeaway

> **`/simple` is the standardized, minimal package index that pip uses to find packages.**
> If an index URL doesn’t end in `/simple`, `pip` will not treat it as a valid PyPI repository.
