## In plain words

Structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other
words how the entities can use each other. Or yet another explanation would
be, they help in answering "How to build a software component?"

## Wikipedia says

In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that
ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between
entities.
