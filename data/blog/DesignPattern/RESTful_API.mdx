title: "What is RESTful API?"

A **RESTful API** is a way for software systems to **talk to each other over HTTP** using a simple, predictable set of rules.
REST stands for **Representational State Transfer**—a design style, not a protocol.

Think of it as:

> *“Use the web the way the web was meant to be used.”*

---

## Core idea (in one sentence)

A RESTful API exposes **resources** (things) via **URLs**, manipulates them using **standard HTTP methods**, and exchanges **representations** (usually JSON).

---

## 1️⃣ Resources (nouns, not verbs)

Everything is a **resource**, identified by a URL:

```
/users
/users/42
/orders/123/items
```

✔ Good

```
GET /users/42
```

❌ Not RESTful

```
GET /getUser?id=42
```

Resources are **nouns**, actions come from HTTP verbs.

---

## 2️⃣ HTTP methods (the actions)

REST reuses standard HTTP verbs with clear meanings:

| Method | Meaning        | Example            |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------ |
| GET    | Read           | `GET /users/42`    |
| POST   | Create         | `POST /users`      |
| PUT    | Replace        | `PUT /users/42`    |
| PATCH  | Partial update | `PATCH /users/42`  |
| DELETE | Remove         | `DELETE /users/42` |

This is one of REST’s biggest wins: **no custom action vocabulary**.

---

## 3️⃣ Statelessness

Each request is **independent**.

* The server does **not remember** previous requests
* All required info is in the request (headers, tokens, body)

✔ Example:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

This makes APIs:

* Easier to scale
* Easier to cache
* Easier to debug

---

## 4️⃣ Representations (usually JSON)

The API returns a **representation** of a resource:

```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}
```

Same resource, different formats are possible:

* JSON (most common)
* XML
* HTML (rare in APIs)

---

## 5️⃣ Proper HTTP status codes

RESTful APIs **use HTTP status codes correctly**:

| Code | Meaning      |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 200  | OK           |
| 201  | Created      |
| 204  | No Content   |
| 400  | Bad Request  |
| 401  | Unauthorized |
| 403  | Forbidden    |
| 404  | Not Found    |
| 409  | Conflict     |
| 500  | Server Error |

❌ Bad:

```json
{ "success": false, "errorCode": 404 }
```

✔ Good:

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

---

## 6️⃣ Optional but “more REST”: HATEOAS

Hypermedia links guide the client:

```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "name": "Alice",
  "links": {
    "self": "/users/42",
    "orders": "/users/42/orders"
  }
}
```

Very “pure REST”, rarely used in practice—but good to know.

---

## What REST is **not**

* ❌ Not tied to JSON (that’s just common)
* ❌ Not the same as HTTP (it uses HTTP)
* ❌ Not enforced by a spec like OpenAPI
* ❌ Not automatically “good design”

---

## REST vs others (quick comparison)

| Style   | Key idea                     |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| REST    | Resources + HTTP semantics   |
| RPC     | Call functions (`getUser()`) |
| GraphQL | Client chooses data shape    |
| gRPC    | Binary, high-performance RPC |

---

## Minimal RESTful example

```http
POST /users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Alice"
}
```

Response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /users/42
```

---

## One-line summary

A **RESTful API** is an API that:

* models data as **resources**
* uses **HTTP methods** correctly
* is **stateless**
* returns **representations** with proper **status codes**
