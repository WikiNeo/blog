Reverting Terraform plan changes depends on **what stage you are at**: before applying, after applying, or after partially applying. Here’s the clear breakdown.

---

## ✅ **1. If you have NOT applied yet (`terraform apply` not run)**

Good news — **nothing has changed in real infrastructure yet.**

To revert:

### **Option A — Discard local changes**

If you changed `.tf` files and no longer want those changes:

```sh
git checkout -- .
```

(or whatever version-control method you use).

Then run:

```sh
terraform plan
```

You should now see no changes.

---

## ✅ **2. If you already APPLIED the plan (`terraform apply` completed)**

Terraform itself **cannot "undo"** changes automatically.
To revert:

### **Option A — Restore previous configuration and re-apply**

1. Check out the older version from Git (or backup):

```sh
git checkout <previous_commit>
```

2. Apply again:

```sh
terraform apply
```

Terraform will then produce a new plan that “undoes” whatever the last apply changed.

---

## ✅ **3. If you applied changes but want to roll back ONLY some resources**

You must restore the previous desired state in your `.tf` files.

Terraform will then:

- Delete resources that should not exist
- Recreate resources with old attributes
- Update resources to previous settings

There is **no single rollback command** — reversion is achieved by re-applying the old configuration.

---

## ✅ **4. If apply FAILED halfway (partial apply)**

Terraform state may contain partially created resources.

To revert:

### **Option A — Fix configuration, then apply again**

Terraform will detect drift and correct it.

### **Option B — Manually remove bad resources from state**

Use only if necessary:

```sh
terraform state rm <resource>
```

Then re-run:

```sh
terraform apply
```

---

## ❌ **What does NOT exist**

Terraform has no:

- `terraform undo`
- `terraform rollback`
- automatic revert mechanism

Everything is done by **changing code back** and running `apply`.

---

## 📌 If you want truly reversible deployments

Use:

- Git versioning for `.tf` files
- Terraform workspaces (sometimes)
- Terragrunt with versioned configurations
- CI pipelines that apply from tagged releases
