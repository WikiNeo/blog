## private

If you set `"private": true`` in your package.json, then npm will refuse to
publish it.

This is a way to prevent accidental publication of private repositories. If
you would like to ensure that a given package is only ever published to a
specific registry (for example, an internal registry), then use the
`publishConfig` dictionary described below to override the `registry` config param
at publish-time.
