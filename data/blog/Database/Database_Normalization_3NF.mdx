Third Normal Form (3NF) is a **database normalization** step that ensures your tables are structured to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity, building on the first (1NF) and second normal forms (2NF).

---

## **Quick Recap Before 3NF**

1. **1NF (First Normal Form)** – No repeating groups, atomic column values, each row is unique.
2. **2NF (Second Normal Form)** – In 1NF, and every non-key attribute is fully dependent on the whole primary key (no partial dependency).

---

## **Definition of 3NF**

A table is in **Third Normal Form** if:

1. **It is already in 2NF**, **and**
2. **It has no transitive dependencies**, meaning:

   - **Non-key attributes** should depend **only** on the primary key, not on another non-key attribute.

**In plain terms:**
Every column should tell you something about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.

## **Example**

### **Before 3NF** (in 2NF but not in 3NF)

```
Orders
-------------------------------------------------
OrderID | CustomerID | CustomerName | CustomerCity
-------------------------------------------------
1       | C001       | Alice        | New York
2       | C002       | Bob          | Los Angeles
3       | C001       | Alice        | New York
```

**Problem:**

- `CustomerName` and `CustomerCity` depend on `CustomerID`, not directly on `OrderID`.
- This is a **transitive dependency**: `OrderID → CustomerID → CustomerName/City`.

---

### **After 3NF**

We split into two tables:

**Orders**

```
OrderID | CustomerID
--------------------
1       | C001
2       | C002
3       | C001
```

**Customers**

```
CustomerID | CustomerName | CustomerCity
----------------------------------------
C001       | Alice        | New York
C002       | Bob          | Los Angeles
```

**Benefits:**

- Avoids storing customer details repeatedly.
- Updating a customer’s city requires changing **only one row** in `Customers`.

## **Why 3NF Matters**

✅ Reduces data duplication
✅ Makes updates faster and less error-prone
✅ Improves data integrity
⚠️ Sometimes too much normalization can hurt performance for read-heavy queries — you might need joins.
