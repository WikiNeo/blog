**Fourth Normal Form (4NF)** is a level of database normalization designed to eliminate **multi-valued dependencies**, which are a more subtle type of redundancy not handled by 3NF or even Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).

### ðŸ”„ Quick Recap of Earlier Forms

| Normal Form | What It Solves                                                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1NF         | Atomicity (no repeating groups, each column has atomic values) |
| 2NF         | Partial dependencies (applies to composite keys)               |
| 3NF         | Transitive dependencies (non-key depending on another non-key) |
| BCNF        | Every determinant is a candidate key (a stricter form of 3NF)  |

### ðŸ§© What Is a Multi-Valued Dependency?

A **multi-valued dependency (MVD)** occurs when:

> For a single value of attribute A, there are **multiple independent values** of attribute B and attribute C â€” and **B and C are independent of each other**.

This leads to **repetition and redundancy** if not separated.

### ðŸ“Œ 4NF Rule

A table is in **4NF** if:

* It is already in **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**
* **AND** it has **no non-trivial multi-valued dependencies**

### ðŸ§  Example

#### Not in 4NF

```text
StudentCoursesLanguages
-------------------------
Student | Course | Language
--------|--------|---------
Alice   | Math   | English
Alice   | Math   | French
Alice   | History| English
Alice   | History| French
```

Here:

* Each **student** can take **multiple courses**
* Each **student** can speak **multiple languages**
* But **Courses and Languages are independent**!

This causes a **multi-valued dependency**:
`Student â†’â†’ Course` and `Student â†’â†’ Language`

#### Split into 4NF

```text
StudentCourses
---------------
Student | Course
--------|--------
Alice   | Math
Alice   | History

StudentLanguages
----------------
Student | Language
--------|----------
Alice   | English
Alice   | French
```

Now the **redundancy is gone**, and **MVDs are eliminated** âœ…

### ðŸ›  Summary

| Aspect           | 4NF                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Based on         | BCNF + No Multi-Valued Dependencies                         |
| Solves           | Redundancy due to independent multivalued facts             |
| Common Fix       | Decompose into multiple relations                           |
| Real-World Usage | Often important in design of **many-to-many relationships** |
