**BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)** is a type of database normalization that is **stricter than 3NF (Third Normal Form)**.
It's used to eliminate redundancy and potential anomalies in relational database design.

### 🔁 TL;DR

> A relation is in **BCNF** if **every determinant is a candidate key**.

---

### 📘 Quick Breakdown

* A **determinant** is any attribute (or set of attributes) on the **left-hand side** of a functional dependency (e.g., `A → B`, A is the determinant).
* A **candidate key** is a minimal set of attributes that can **uniquely identify** every tuple (row) in the relation.

---

### 📋 Formal Definition

A relation `R` is in **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)** if:

> For every non-trivial functional dependency `X → Y` in `R`,
> `X` is a **super key** (i.e., it can uniquely identify tuples).

**"Non-trivial"** means `Y` is not a subset of `X`.

---

### ✅ When Is BCNF Needed?

Even if a table is in **3NF**, it might **still not be in BCNF** if:

* There are **multiple candidate keys**, and
* Some **non-primary candidate key** determines attributes

---

### 🔧 Example

Let’s say you have a table:

| StudentID | Course  | Instructor |
| --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1         | Math    | Prof. A    |
| 2         | Math    | Prof. A    |
| 3         | History | Prof. B    |

**Functional dependencies:**

* `StudentID → Course, Instructor` ✅ (StudentID is a candidate key)
* `Course → Instructor` ❌ (Course is not a candidate key)

Here, `Course → Instructor` violates BCNF because `Course` is not a superkey.

---

### 💡 Fixing It

Split into two tables:

1. **StudentCourse(StudentID, Course)**
2. **CourseInstructor(Course, Instructor)**

Now both are in **BCNF**, and the redundancy is removed.

---

Here are the BCNF-fixed tables derived from the example:

### 1) `StudentCourse`

Stores which course each student takes.
**PK:** `(StudentID, Course)`

| StudentID | Course  |
| --------- | ------- |
| 1         | Math    |
| 2         | Math    |
| 3         | History |

### 2) `CourseInstructor`

Captures the functional dependency **Course → Instructor**.
**PK:** `Course`

| Course  | Instructor |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Math    | Prof. A    |
| History | Prof. B    |
