In architecture and engineering documentation, **RFC** and **ADR** are two common but distinct types of documents used to drive clarity and alignment.

---

## 1️⃣ RFC — _Request for Comments_

### What it is

An **RFC** is a proposal document used to present a new idea, change, or improvement and gather feedback before making a decision.

### Purpose

- Socialize a proposal early
- Collect feedback from stakeholders
- Surface risks and alternatives
- Build alignment before implementation

### When to use it

- Proposing a new system or major feature
- Suggesting architectural changes
- Introducing new tooling or frameworks
- Changing APIs or core workflows

### Typical RFC Structure

- **Title**
- **Author(s)**
- **Status** (Draft, Reviewing, Approved, Rejected)
- **Background / Context**
- **Problem Statement**
- **Proposed Solution**
- **Alternatives Considered**
- **Trade-offs**
- **Open Questions**
- **Rollout Plan**
- **Impact / Risks**

### Key Characteristic

➡️ An RFC is **forward-looking and discussion-oriented**.

It exists to answer:

> “Should we do this, and how?”

## 2️⃣ ADR — _Architecture Decision Record_

### What it is

An **ADR** is a document that records a final architectural decision and the reasoning behind it.

### Purpose

- Capture why a decision was made
- Preserve context for future engineers
- Prevent re-litigating past decisions
- Provide historical traceability

### When to use it

- After a significant architectural decision is made
- When selecting technologies
- When defining system boundaries or patterns
- When making irreversible trade-offs

### Typical ADR Structure

- **Title**
- **Status** (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Context**
- **Decision**
- **Consequences**
- **Alternatives Considered**

### Key Characteristic

➡️ An ADR is **backward-looking and record-oriented**.

It answers:

> “What did we decide and why?”

# 🔄 How RFC and ADR Work Together

Often they are part of the same lifecycle:

1. **RFC is written** → discussion and feedback
2. RFC is approved
3. Key decisions are extracted into one or more **ADRs**
4. ADR becomes part of the permanent architecture record

Think of it like:

- RFC = _Debate & Proposal_
- ADR = _Decision & Documentation_

# 🆚 Quick Comparison

| Aspect            | RFC                       | ADR                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Purpose           | Propose & gather feedback | Record a decision                      |
| Timing            | Before decision           | After decision                         |
| Tone              | Exploratory               | Authoritative                          |
| Changes over time | May evolve during review  | Usually immutable (new ADR if changed) |
| Audience          | Broad stakeholders        | Future engineers & maintainers         |

# 🧠 Why They Matter

Without RFCs:

- Decisions are made without alignment.
- Surprises happen late.

Without ADRs:

- Context is lost.
- Teams re-argue old decisions.
- Knowledge disappears when people leave.
