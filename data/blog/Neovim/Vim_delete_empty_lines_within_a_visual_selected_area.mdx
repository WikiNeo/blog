## The command

```
:'<,'>g/^$/d
```

---

## 1️⃣ `'<,'>` — the range (your visual selection)

* `'<` = start of the last **Visual selection**
* `'>` = end of the last **Visual selection**
* Together, `'<,'>` means:

👉 **Apply the command only to the lines you selected in Visual mode**

So this command **does not affect the whole file**, only the selected block.

---

## 2️⃣ `g` — global command (within the range)

* `g/pattern/command`
* For **each line matching `pattern`**, run `command`

Here, it means:
👉 *For every line in the selected range that matches the pattern…*

---

## 3️⃣ `/^$/` — the pattern (empty lines)

Regex breakdown:

* `^` = start of line
* `$` = end of line
* Nothing between them → **line contains nothing**

👉 Matches **empty lines only**

* Does **not** match lines with spaces or tabs

(If you want whitespace-only lines too, see below.)

---

## 4️⃣ `d` — delete

* `d` = delete the matched line

---

## ✅ Final meaning (plain English)

> **Delete all empty lines inside the selected region.**

---

## Common variations (very useful)

### 🔹 Delete empty lines in the entire file

```
:g/^$/d
```

---

### 🔹 Delete empty *and whitespace-only* lines

```
:'<,'>g/^\s*$/d
```

* `\s*` = any amount of whitespace (spaces, tabs)

---

### 🔹 Inverse: delete all **non-empty** lines in selection

```
:'<,'>g!/^$/d
```

or

```
:'<,'>v/^$/d
```

---

## Typical workflow (how you’d use it)

1. Press `V` (or `v`) to select lines
2. Adjust selection
3. Type `:` (Vim auto-fills `'<,'>`)
4. Enter `g/^$/d`
5. Press `Enter`
