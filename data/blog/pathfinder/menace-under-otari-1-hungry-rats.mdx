The stairs leading into the basement of the Otari Fishery creak with age as you
make your way downstairs to find the beast that has been eating all the fish. In
the center of the room, between stone pillars holding up the fishery overhead,
are barrels filled with salted fish. Two of thse barrels have been smashed
open, spilling their contents onthe floor. In the east wall is a large hole,
opening into darkness.

Just a few hours ago, you gathered with a few other adventures in the office of
Tamily Tanderveil's office, where she offered you ten gold pieces each if you
could put an end to this menace. She was thrilled when you agreed to help her
with this simple task, but as you make your way downstairs, you can't help but
wonder if this might be a lot more adventure than you bargained for.

A strange chittering comes from the hole in the wall. Suddenly, a massive rat of
the size of a dog emerges from the darkness - and it isn't alone! The giant rats
rush towards you, their huge teeth snapping.

通往奥塔里渔场地下室的楼梯在你们脚下嘎吱作响，似乎已经年久失修。你们小心翼翼地走下去，寻找那个吃光了腌鱼的怪物。

房间中央，几根石柱支撑着上方的渔场结构，柱子之间堆放着几桶腌鱼。两桶鱼已经被打翻，腌鱼撒了一地。在东侧的墙上，有一个巨大的洞口，黑漆漆的，伸向未知的深处。

就在几个小时前，你们在塔米莉·坦德维尔的办公室里和其他几位冒险者会合。她许诺每人十枚金币，只要你们能除掉这个祸害。你们爽快地答应了，她显得十分高兴，觉得这只是个简单的小任务。但现在，当你们一步步走进地下室，心中却忍不住泛起疑问——这趟冒险，真的只是“简单”吗？

一阵奇怪的唧唧声从洞穴深处传来。突然，一只狗大小的巨鼠从黑暗中钻了出来——而且，它并不孤单！这些巨大的老鼠张开满是利齿的嘴巴，向你们猛扑而来！
