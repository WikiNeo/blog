The small seaside town of Otari is known for its fresh fish and skilled sailors,
but above all, it's a big logging town, providing valuable wood to nearby
metropolis of Absalom. But for you, Otari is home. You grew up playing on the
docks, getting lost in the nearby woods, and hearing the fantastical stories of
travelers from faraway lands, tales of terrifying dragons and virtuous knights.
Such adventure always seemed so distant - until today!

Words has begun to spread around Otari that there's problem down at the Otari
Fishery. Some are saying that some sort of beast is lurking in the basement,
feeding on the stores of salted fish. Folks are worried whatever is eating the
fish might get hungry enough to eat the fisher next!

You have received a letter from Tamily Tanderveil, the owner of the fishery.
Inside is a desperate plea for help. With the town guard busy protecting the
loggers, she needs a few brave souls to venture down into the basement of her
warehouse and put an end to the beast that's feasting on her fish! Do you have
the courage to face the menace under Otari?

奥塔里是一个位于海边的小镇，以新鲜的鱼获和技艺高超的水手闻名，但最出名的还是它的伐木业——源源不断地为附近的大都市阿布萨隆提供珍贵的木材。对你来说，奥塔里更是你的家。你在码头边玩耍，在附近的森林中迷路，也常常听着来自远方旅人讲述那些奇幻的故事——恐怖的巨龙、正义的骑士，那些冒险的故事总是那么遥不可及——直到今天！
