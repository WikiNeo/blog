## Bijection in Set Theory

A **bijection** (or **bijective function**) is a function that is both *injective* and *surjective* — that is, a one-to-one correspondence between two sets.

---

### Definition

Given two sets $A$ and $B$, a function  
$$
f: A \to B
$$
is a **bijection** if:

1. **Injective (one-to-one):**
   $$
   \forall a_1, a_2 \in A,\ f(a_1) = f(a_2) \implies a_1 = a_2
   $$

2. **Surjective (onto):**
   $$
   \forall b \in B,\ \exists a \in A \text{ such that } f(a) = b
   $$

If both conditions hold, each element of $A$ corresponds to exactly one unique element of $B$, and vice versa.

### Examples

**Finite example:**

$$
A = \{1, 2, 3\}, \quad B = \{a, b, c\}
$$
Define $f(1)=a,\ f(2)=b,\ f(3)=c$.  
✅ This is a bijection — each element of $A$ matches exactly one in $B$.

**Infinite example:**

$$
f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}, \quad f(x) = x + 1
$$
✅ This is also bijective, since it’s both injective and surjective.

### Why It Matters

If there exists a bijection between two sets $A$ and $B$, they have the **same cardinality** (the same “size”), even if they’re infinite.  
For example:
$$
\mathbb{N} \leftrightarrow \text{even numbers } 2\mathbb{N}
$$

### In Set Theory vs. Real Analysis

| Context | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Set theory** | Purely structural — about correspondence between sets. Used to define cardinality. |
| **Real analysis** | Adds extra properties (continuity, differentiability). Bijection helps define invertible functions like $f(x) = e^x$ and its inverse $\ln(x)$. |
