This large room looks like it was once a storeroom for a building above. At the
far side, you can make out what might have been a cage or cell at some point,
but it is now full of crates and barrels. Four lizardlike creatures the size of
human children are clustered around the door to the cell, trying to pry it
open.

这间宽敞的房间看起来曾是地面上某座建筑的储藏室。在远处，你依稀可以辨认出那曾经可能是一个牢笼或囚室的结构，但现在里面堆满了箱子和木桶。
四只蜥蜴般的生物，体型如同人类儿童，正聚集在囚室门口，试图将其撬开。
