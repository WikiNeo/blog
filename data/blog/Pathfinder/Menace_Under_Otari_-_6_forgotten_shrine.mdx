---

The ancient wooden door creaks open on rusty hinges, revealing a ruined
chamber. Mold and rot stain every surface. On the far side of the room is stone
statue of a giant squid, its tentacles reaching toward an altar in the center
of the chamber. The scum covers almost everything, but it hasn’t touched the
silver bowl sitting atop the stone altar. The water in the bowl is perfectly
clear.

## Chinese

锈蚀的铰链发出嘎吱声，古老的木门缓缓打开，露出一间破败的房间。霉菌与腐烂覆盖了几乎所有表面。
房间的另一侧矗立着一座巨型乌贼的石像，它的触手伸向房间中央的祭坛。
污垢几乎布满了整间屋子，唯独没有沾染祭坛上那只银制的碗。碗中的水清澈透明。
