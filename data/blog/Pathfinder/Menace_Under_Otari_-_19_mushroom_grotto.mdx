summary: Towering yellow mushrooms cover the floor of this vast cave
---

Towering yellow mushrooms cover the floor of this vast cave, some reaching over
ten feet in height. They seem to emit a pale light, giving the entire chamber
an eerie glow. Shattered remnants of barrels—torn open with their contents
nowhere to be seen—lay scattered around the base of the mushrooms. Somewhere
off on the far side of the chamber, something stirs, and a faint snarl comes
from the shadows.

## Chinese

巨大的黄色蘑菇覆盖着这片广阔的洞穴地面，其中一些高达三米以上。它们似乎散发着微弱的光芒，为整个房间染上一层诡异的光辉。破碎的木桶残骸散落在蘑菇根部四周，桶盖被撕开，内容物早已不知去向。在洞穴的远处某个角落，有什么东西动了一下，阴影中传来一声低沉的咆哮。
