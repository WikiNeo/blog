The tunnel continues deeper undergroud, eventually opening into a large
chamber. Patches of glowing blue fungus cling to the ceiling and provide dim
light. You can just barely make out vast strands of webbing arcoss the floor
and walls of this cavern, stretching between stalactites like shimmering
curtains.
