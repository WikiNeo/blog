After the web-infested cave, the passgeway leading deeper underneath the street
of Otari appears to be mostly natural, but someone, or something, has worked to
open the cavern and level out the floor, making the passge easily traveled. A
crude barricade made from old wooden planks and part of a barrel blocks the
entrance to a side tunnel, while the main passage coontinues off into the
gloom.

## Chinese

穿过布满蛛网的洞穴后，通往奥塔利街道下方更深处的通道看起来大多是天然形成的，但有人——或某种生物——曾在这里挖掘扩宽，并将地面整平，使这条通道更容易通行。一道由破旧木板和半个木桶搭成的简陋路障堵住了通往侧边隧道的入口，而主通道则继续延伸进幽暗之中。
