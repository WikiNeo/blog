summary: Beyond the barricade, the passageway meanders briefly.
---

Beyond the barricade, the passageway meanders briefly. The floor descends
slightly and soon becomes flooded by a shallow pool of water. The water appears
to be flowing out of a passageway to the right, and a shimmering blue light in
that direction reflects off of the water there. The main passageway continues
to the left, over the slight depression in the floor where the water has
pooled. An overpowering stench drifts from around a bend.

## Chinese

越过路障后，通道略微蜿蜒，地面逐渐下沉，很快被一层浅水淹没。水流似乎来自右侧的一条支路，那边传来微微闪烁的蓝光，在水面上反射出粼粼波光。主通道则继续向左延伸，越过那片积水的低洼地。一股刺鼻的恶臭从转角处飘来。
