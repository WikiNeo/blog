summary: On the far side of the puddle of water is a strange chamber
---

On the far side of the puddle of water is a strange chamber, crackling with
magical energy. Pulsing orbs float in three of the four corners of this room.
The orb in the southwest is made of brown earth and stone, whereas the one in
the northeast looks to be made of glass, and is filled with a swirling cloud.
The orb in the far corner holds a roaring flame; opposite that orb are
shattered remains and the water that flows down the passageway to the
northwest.

## Chinese

在积水的另一侧，是一间奇异的房间，充斥着噼啪作响的魔法能量。三颗脉动的球体漂浮在房间四个角落中的三个。西南角的球体由棕色的泥土与岩石构成；东北角的是透明玻璃质地，内部充满了翻滚的云雾；最远处角落的球体中燃烧着熊熊火焰。与那颗火焰球体相对的角落则是破碎的残骸，那里有水流从中涌出，顺着通道向西北方向流淌而去。
