The door to this chamber silently glides open to reveal a long room. Two stone
statues of priests stand in the corners along one side of the room, facing a
towering statue of a man holding out both of his hands, palms up. In front of
this statue is a stone altar holding nine golden coins. A voice booms out from
the statue. “In my hands I judge the value of all wealth, raising up whichever
is greater. One of these coins is a deception. Find it using only two judgments
and receive my blessing.”

这间房的门无声地滑开，露出一间狭长的房间。房间一侧的角落里立着两尊祭司的石像，面朝一座高大的男性雕像——他双手向前伸出，掌心朝上。
雕像前摆放着一座石质祭坛，祭坛上放有九枚金币。就在这时，雕像中传出洪亮的声音：
“我在掌中衡量万物之值，举起最为贵重之物。这九枚金币中有一枚是伪造之物。仅用两次判断，找出它，便可得我赐福。”
