summary: As the door opens, the smell of rotten fish and mold wafts out
---

As the door opens, the smell of rotten fish and mold wafts out. On the west
side of this vast room is a large table with benches on either side. Old food
scraps, dirty knives, and broken plates cover the table. Off to the east side,
burrows have been dug into the wall to make small sleeping chambers filled with
straw mats. This must be the kobolds’ warren!

## Chinese

当门打开时，一股腐鱼和霉菌的气味扑面而来。这间宽敞的房间西侧摆着一张大桌子，两侧各有长凳。桌面上堆满了残羹冷炙、肮脏的刀具和破碎的盘子。东侧的墙壁被挖出几个洞穴，形成小小的睡眠区，里面铺着稻草垫子。这里一定是狗头人的巢穴！
