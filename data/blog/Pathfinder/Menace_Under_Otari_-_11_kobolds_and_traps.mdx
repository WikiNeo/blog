The door opens with a creak, revealing a massive chamber that looks like an audience
hall. On the far side, a broad set of stairs leads up to where a throne might
once have been. Pillars support the high ceiling, and the ruined tatters of
once decorative banners still hang from them. A decorative tile pattern
centered in the middle of the room shows through the grim coating the floor.

门吱呀一声打开，显露出一间巨大的大厅，看起来像是昔日的会客殿。远处，一道宽阔的楼梯通向高台，那里曾经可能摆放着王座。高高的天花板由几根石柱支撑，柱子上还残留着破损褪色的装饰旗帜。房间中央地面上，一幅装饰性的瓷砖图案隐约显露在尘垢之下。
