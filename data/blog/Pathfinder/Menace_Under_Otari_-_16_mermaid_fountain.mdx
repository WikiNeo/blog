summary: While much of this rectangular chamber is in ruins
---

While much of this rectangular chamber is in ruins, the center contains a
fountain of pristine water with something glittering at the bottom. In the
middle of the fountain is a marble statue of a mermaid, her lips pursed as if
she were about to blow a kiss, or maybe whistle. Each corner of the pool has
some sort of mechanism embedded in the stones, but the one in the southwest
corner appears to be smashed.

虽然这间长方形的房间大部分已成废墟，但中央仍保留着一座清澈的喷泉，泉底有某样闪闪发光的东西。喷泉中央立着一尊大理石雕刻的美人鱼像，她双唇微抿，仿佛正要吹吻，或是吹口哨。喷泉四角的石块中嵌有某种机械装置，但西南角的装置似乎已被砸毁。
