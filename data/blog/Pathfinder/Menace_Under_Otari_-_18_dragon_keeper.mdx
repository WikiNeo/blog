A gaping pit opens in the floor in the center of this large, natural chamber.
On the far side, a ledge overlooks the entry. Atop this ledge is an ornate
stone throne that looks entirely out of place for this room. A regal kobold
wearing an oversized crown made of fish bones sits atop the throne. “Kill the
intruders!” she snarls at the two kobold guards at the foot of the stairs.

这个宽大的天然洞穴中央，地面张开着一个巨大的深坑。远处的高台俯瞰着入口，高台上放着一张华丽的石制王座，与这间粗犷的洞穴格格不入。一只头戴由鱼骨制成的夸张王冠的狗头人正坐在王座上，神态威严。她朝着站在阶梯下的两名狗头人守卫怒吼：“干掉这些入侵者！”
