In the mathematical field of graph theory, a **spanning tree** _T_ of an undirected
graph _G_ is a subgraph that is a tree which includes all of the vertices of
_G_.[1] In general, a graph may have several spanning trees, but a graph that is
not connected will not contain a spanning tree (see about spanning forests
below). If all of the edges of _G_ are also edges of a spanning tree _T_ of _G_,
then _G_ is a tree and is identical to _T_ (that is, a tree has a unique spanning
tree and it is itself).
