**Asymmetric cryptography** (also called **public-key cryptography**) is a type of encryption that uses **two different but mathematically related keys**:

- **Public key** → shared with everyone
- **Private key** → kept secret by the owner

What one key encrypts, **only the other key can decrypt**.

## How it works (simple idea)

1. You generate a **key pair**: public + private
2. You share your **public key**
3. Someone encrypts data using your **public key**
4. Only **your private key** can decrypt that data

So even if attackers intercept the encrypted message, they **cannot read it** without the private key.

## Why asymmetric cryptography is useful

It solves a major problem of symmetric cryptography:

> **How do we securely share a secret key in the first place?**

With asymmetric cryptography:

- No secret needs to be exchanged ahead of time
- Trust can be established over insecure networks (like the internet)

## Common use cases

### 1. Secure communication (HTTPS / TLS)

- Your browser uses the server’s **public key**
- A secure connection is established without sharing secrets openly

### 2. Digital signatures

- Sender signs data with their **private key**
- Anyone can verify it using the **public key**
- Ensures:

  - Authenticity
  - Integrity
  - Non-repudiation

### 3. Key exchange

- Asymmetric crypto is often used to **safely exchange a symmetric key**
- After that, faster symmetric encryption is used for data transfer

## Popular asymmetric algorithms

| Algorithm                             | Purpose                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **RSA**                               | Encryption, digital signatures  |
| **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)** | Smaller keys, higher efficiency |
| **DSA / ECDSA**                       | Digital signatures              |
| **Diffie-Hellman (DH / ECDH)**        | Secure key exchange             |

## Asymmetric vs Symmetric (quick comparison)

| Feature    | Asymmetric               | Symmetric            |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Keys       | Public + Private         | Single shared key    |
| Speed      | Slower                   | Faster               |
| Security   | Easier key distribution  | Harder key sharing   |
| Common use | Key exchange, signatures | Bulk data encryption |

👉 **In practice:** both are used together.

## Real-world analogy

🔐 **Mailbox example**

- Public key = mailbox slot (anyone can drop a letter)
- Private key = mailbox key (only you can open it)
