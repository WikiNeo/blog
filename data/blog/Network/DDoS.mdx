**DDoS** stands for **Distributed Denial of Service**.

It’s a type of cyberattack where **many machines attack a target at the same time**, overwhelming it so legitimate users can’t access the service.

## What happens in a DDoS attack?

1. **Attacker controls many devices**
   These devices are often compromised computers, servers, or IoT devices (called a **botnet**).

2. **All devices send traffic simultaneously**
   They flood the target (website, API, game server, etc.) with requests.

3. **Target is overwhelmed**

   - CPU maxed out
   - Memory exhausted
   - Network bandwidth saturated

4. **Legitimate users are denied service**
   The site becomes slow or completely unavailable.

## Why is it called _Distributed_?

Because the attack doesn’t come from one place — it comes from **thousands or millions of sources** across the internet, making it very hard to block.

## Common types of DDoS attacks

### 1. **Volume-based attacks**

- Goal: **Consume bandwidth**
- Example: UDP flood, ICMP (ping) flood
- Think: _“Too much traffic on the highway”_

### 2. **Protocol attacks**

- Goal: **Exhaust server resources**
- Example: SYN flood
- Exploits weaknesses in network protocols

### 3. **Application-layer attacks**

- Goal: **Crash specific services**
- Example: HTTP GET/POST flood
- Looks like normal user traffic → hardest to detect

## Simple analogy

Imagine a restaurant:

- Normal customers: manageable
- Suddenly **10,000 fake customers** walk in and order nothing
- Real customers can’t get a seat
  ➡️ That’s DDoS

---

## What DDoS is _not_

- ❌ Not hacking into your system
- ❌ Not stealing data
- ✅ It’s about **making your service unavailable**

---

## How organizations defend against DDoS

- Rate limiting
- Traffic filtering
- Load balancers
- CDNs (e.g. Cloud-based DDoS protection)
- Anycast routing

---

## One-sentence summary

> **A DDoS attack overwhelms a service with massive, distributed traffic so real users can’t access it.**
