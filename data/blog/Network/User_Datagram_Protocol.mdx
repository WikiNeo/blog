### ðŸ’¡ What is UDP?

UDP is one of the core protocols of the **Internet Protocol Suite**, used to send messages called **datagrams** between computers.

It is part of the **transport layer** (Layer 4) of the OSI model, just like **TCP**. But unlike TCP, **UDP is connectionless and unreliable**â€”meaning it sends data without establishing a connection or guaranteeing delivery.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features

| Feature                   | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Connectionless**        | No handshake or setup between sender and receiver before sending data |
| **Unreliable**            | No guarantee the data will arrive or arrive in order                  |
| **Lightweight**           | Minimal overhead (faster than TCP)                                    |
| **No congestion control** | Sends as fast as the application allows (can lead to packet loss)     |

### ðŸ§± UDP Packet Structure

A UDP packet (datagram) contains:

- **Source Port**
- **Destination Port**
- **Length** (header + data)
- **Checksum** (optional integrity check)
- **Data**

### ðŸ“¦ Use Cases

Because UDP is fast and doesn't wait for acknowledgments, itâ€™s ideal for time-sensitive or high-speed applications:

- **Streaming media** (video/audio)
- **Online gaming**
- **VoIP (Voice over IP)**
- **DNS** (Domain Name System)
- **TFTP** (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)

### ðŸ†š UDP vs TCP

| Feature     | UDP                      | TCP                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Connection  | No (connectionless)      | Yes (connection-oriented)     |
| Reliability | No (packets may be lost) | Yes (guarantees delivery)     |
| Order       | No                       | Yes                           |
| Speed       | Faster                   | Slower due to acknowledgments |
| Use Case    | Streaming, gaming        | Web browsing, file transfer   |
