**BORE Scheduler** stands for **Burst-Oriented Response Enhancer**.
It’s an **alternative Linux CPU scheduler** designed to make desktops feel _more responsive_, especially under mixed or heavy system load.

Since you’re using **CachyOS with Hyprland**, this is particularly relevant—BORE is one of the reasons CachyOS often feels very “snappy”.

---

## What problem does BORE try to solve?

The default Linux scheduler (**CFS – Completely Fair Scheduler**) is excellent for servers and throughput, but on desktops it can feel less responsive when:

- a game is compiling shaders
- a browser tab goes wild
- background tasks spike CPU
- multiple apps wake up at once

CFS treats CPU time _fairly_, not _urgently_.

BORE asks a different question:

> **“Which task needs the CPU _right now_ to keep the system responsive?”**

---

## Core idea of BORE

**Short CPU bursts = interactive tasks = higher priority**

Examples:

- moving a window
- typing in a terminal
- scrolling a webpage
- compositor (Hyprland) rendering
- game main thread

**Long continuous CPU usage = background work**

- compiling
- video encoding
- shader pre-caching
- AI workloads

BORE detects this automatically by tracking **burst time**.

---

## How BORE works (simplified)

1. Each task has a **burst score**

   - short bursts → low score → high priority
   - long bursts → high score → lower priority

2. Scheduler dynamically:

   - boosts interactive tasks
   - gently pushes background hogs out of the way

3. No user tagging required

   - no need for `nice`, `ionice`, or manual tuning

---

## Why BORE feels good on desktops

Compared to CFS, BORE typically gives:

- 🚀 **snappier UI**
- 🪟 smoother window animations (great for Hyprland)
- 🎮 more consistent frame pacing in games
- 🖱️ better mouse/keyboard responsiveness under load

Especially noticeable when:

- gaming + browser + Discord
- Steam shader compilation in background
- multiple Electron apps open

## BORE vs other schedulers

| Scheduler | Best for            | Notes                                 |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **CFS**   | Servers, fairness   | Default Linux scheduler               |
| **BORE**  | Desktop, gaming     | Low-latency, responsive               |
| **ECHO**  | Desktop             | Earlier interactive-focused scheduler |
| **MuQSS** | Extreme low latency | Less scalable, niche                  |
| **EEVDF** | Modern fairness     | Now in mainline Linux                 |

BORE is **not mainline** yet, but is well-tested in desktop-focused distros like CachyOS.

## Why CachyOS uses / offers BORE

CachyOS focuses on:

- desktop responsiveness
- gaming performance
- low-latency tuning

BORE pairs very well with:

- **Hyprland**
- **NVIDIA drivers**
- **gamescope**
- high-refresh-rate displays (your 144 Hz Philips fits perfectly)

On your **i5-10400F + RTX 3080**, BORE helps ensure:

- the game thread doesn’t get delayed by background CPU noise
- the compositor stays smooth even when CPU usage spikes

---

## Downsides / trade-offs

To be fair:

- ❌ slightly worse for long batch jobs
- ❌ not ideal for heavy server workloads
- ❌ not upstream Linux (yet)

For a **desktop / gaming machine**, these are usually irrelevant.

---

## TL;DR

**BORE Scheduler** is a Linux CPU scheduler that:

- prioritizes **short, interactive CPU bursts**
- improves **desktop responsiveness and gaming smoothness**
- works especially well on **CachyOS + Hyprland**
