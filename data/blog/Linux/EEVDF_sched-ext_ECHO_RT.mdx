## 1️⃣ **EEVDF (Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline First)**

**Status:** Upstream Linux default (since Linux 6.6)

### What it is

EEVDF is the **modern replacement for CFS** (Completely Fair Scheduler).
It is a **deadline-based scheduler** designed to improve **fairness, latency, and interactivity**.

Instead of “who ran least recently?”, it asks:

> *Who has the earliest virtual deadline and is eligible to run now?*

### Why it exists

CFS struggled with:

* Bursty interactive workloads
* Low-latency desktop responsiveness
* Edge cases with fairness under mixed loads

EEVDF fixes these while remaining **fully fair and general-purpose**.

### Key characteristics

* ⚖️ Strict fairness guarantees
* ⚡ Lower scheduling latency than CFS
* 🧠 Better handling of interactive bursts (UI, browsers, games)
* 🔄 Fully upstream and well-tested

### How it feels in practice

* Smooth desktop
* Consistent frame pacing
* No surprises under load

### Best for

✅ **General desktop use**
✅ **Gaming + background tasks**
✅ **Coding, compiling, browsing simultaneously**

👉 If you want **“it just works”**, this is the safe baseline.

## 2️⃣ **sched-ext (Scheduler Extensions)**

**Status:** Experimental but upstream framework

### What it is

`sched-ext` is **not a scheduler**, but a **framework** that allows **user-space schedulers** written in **BPF** to control task scheduling.

Think of it as:

> *“Pluggable scheduling logic without recompiling the kernel.”*

### Why it exists

Kernel scheduling experimentation is:

* Hard
* Slow
* Risky

sched-ext allows:

* Rapid prototyping
* Custom schedulers per workload
* Research & experimentation

### Key characteristics

* 🧩 User-space defined scheduling logic
* 🔬 Ideal for experimentation
* ⚠️ Can be unstable depending on the scheduler used
* 🧠 Extremely flexible

### How it feels in practice

* Depends entirely on the scheduler plugged in
* Can be amazing or terrible
* Debugging requires expertise

### Best for

✅ Scheduler developers
✅ Researchers
✅ Power users experimenting with custom policies

❌ Not ideal for daily gaming or productivity (yet)

## 3️⃣ **ECHO Scheduler**

**Status:** Out-of-tree / niche (CachyOS custom)

### What it is

ECHO is a **latency-oriented scheduler** designed for:

* **Fast wake-ups**
* **Minimal overhead**
* **Desktop responsiveness**

It prioritizes:

* Recently interactive tasks
* UI-related workloads
* Short CPU bursts

### Design philosophy

> *“Responsiveness first, fairness second.”*

Unlike EEVDF:

* Less strict fairness
* More aggressive prioritization of interactive tasks

### Key characteristics

* ⚡ Very snappy UI
* 🎮 Good for gaming input latency
* 📉 Can reduce throughput fairness under heavy load
* 🧪 Less tested than EEVDF

### How it feels in practice

* Very “light”
* UI reacts instantly
* Heavy background jobs may feel deprioritized

### Best for

✅ **Gaming-focused systems**
✅ **Minimal background workloads**
✅ **Low-latency desktop feel**

❌ Not ideal if you compile kernels while gaming

## 4️⃣ **RT (Real-Time Scheduler)**

**Status:** Linux core (SCHED_FIFO / SCHED_RR)

### What it is

RT scheduling is **hard priority scheduling**:

* RT tasks **always preempt** normal tasks
* No fairness guarantees
* Can **lock up your system** if misused

### Types

* **SCHED_FIFO** – runs until it blocks or yields
* **SCHED_RR** – round-robin among RT tasks

### Key characteristics

* 🚨 Absolute priority
* ⛔ Can starve the system
* 🎯 Deterministic timing

### How it feels in practice

* Used by:

  * Audio engines (JACK, PipeWire RT threads)
  * Industrial control
  * Robotics

### Best for

✅ **Audio production**
✅ **Hard real-time requirements**

❌ **Never** use as a general desktop scheduler

## 🔎 Quick Comparison

| Scheduler     | Goal            | Fairness | Latency | Stability | Recommended |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------- | ------- | --------- | ----------- |
| **EEVDF**     | General purpose | ⭐⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐     | ✅ Default   |
| **sched-ext** | Experimentation | Depends  | Depends | ⭐⭐        | ⚠️ Advanced |
| **ECHO**      | Desktop latency | ⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐       | ⚠️ Gaming   |
| **RT**        | Determinism     | ❌        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐      | ❌ Desktop   |

## 🧠 Practical Advice for *Your* Setup (CachyOS + Hyprland + RTX 3080)

* **EEVDF** → Best balance for **gaming + coding**
* **ECHO** → Try if you want *maximum snappiness* and minimal background load
* **sched-ext** → Only if you enjoy kernel experimentation
* **RT** → Leave it alone unless doing audio or robotics
