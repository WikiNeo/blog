The groups the user is member of define what activities the user can perform.

For instance, to create a user called larry who is member of the *wheel*, *users*,
and *audio* groups, log in as root first (only root can create users) and run
**useradd**:

```shell
Login: root
Password: (Enter the root password)

root # useradd -m -G users,wheel,audio -s /bin/bash larry
root # passwd larry
Password: (Enter the password for larry)
Re-enter password: (Re-enter the password to verify)
```
